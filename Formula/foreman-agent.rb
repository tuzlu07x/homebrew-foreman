    <<~EOS
      Get started:
        foreman setup      # 5-minute wizard: providers, agents, services
        foreman start      # the TUI, where risky calls wait for your OK

      Optional: `foreman service install` keeps Foreman's daemon running at
      login. It runs Homebrew's Node by its full path, so run it again after
      `brew upgrade` updates node or foreman-agent (`foreman service status`
      warns when it points at a version that is gone).

      Foreman keeps its state (identity key, policy.yaml, audit database)
      outside the Homebrew prefix; `foreman doctor` prints where. Upgrading
      or uninstalling the formula does NOT touch it. For a clean removal see
        https://github.com/tuzlu07x/foreman/blob/main/docs/install.md#uninstall
